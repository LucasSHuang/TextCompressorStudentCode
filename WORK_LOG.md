| April 5 |    9-10pm     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| Dec 2   | 11:40-11:55pm | I began thinking about how to solve the problem set. Right now I'm thinking of solving it in the way of Vikram's idea where you make every word a differnt "code" of 8 bits. I just need to figure out a way to put them in a map because I feel like that would take so much time because then you would have to read through the entire text first to add every possible word. |
| Dec 3   |   7-7:45pm    |                                                                                              Building off the the solution above, I tried to think of ways to implement every single word of the text in a way that we could check it and then compress it. I looked back at some previous problem sets and realized that a trie would be a pretty good way to track every word. |
| Dec 4   |  10-11:30pm   |                                                                                                                   I implemented the trie and added the words into the trie but now I realize that you can't really do anything with it. I need to find a way to turn these words into compressed codes. I probably have to wait for the hint to figure out exactly how to do it. |
| Dec 11  |  11-11:55pm   |                                                                                                                   I tried to finish the compress problem set. I thought I had finished it but I encountered a problem which is that I am having some index out of bounds errors when compressing. I need to find a way to find the bug and solve it which will be my next steps. |
