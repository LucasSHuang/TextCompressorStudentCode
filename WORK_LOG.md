| Dec 2   | 11:40-11:55pm | I began thinking about how to solve the problem set. Right now I'm thinking of solving it in the way of Vikram's idea where you make every word a differnt "code" of 8 bits. I just need to figure out a way to put them in a map because I feel like that would take so much time because then you would have to read through the entire text first to add every possible word. |
